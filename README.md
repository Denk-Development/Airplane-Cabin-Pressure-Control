# Pressure Control Software

## Hardware

This Arduino software was developed by Denk Development in Mar 2019 for the microcontroller Atmega 328P.

### Wiring

_as-is_ + the following
* Connect a second Arduino to the motor through a motor shield (shield pins 1 and 2, as well as GND and VCC).
* Connect the Main-Arduino to the Motor-Arduino by hooking up the digital pins 6 <--> 6 and 7 <--> 7, as well as GND <--> GND.

## Software Architecture

The software is split into the following sub-parts:

* **Main program**. Controls the program flow and contains the main event loop.
* **Pressure delta**. Two things: (1) Reads the analog input from a potentiometer which is set by the user to control the target pressure difference. Its output is a pressure difference in PSI (float). (2) Reads the analog input from a pressure sensor. The values correspond to the difference between cabin pressure and external pressure. Yields values in PSI (float).
* **Display controller**. Shows four things on the display: (1) selected target pressure, (2) measured pressure, (3) motor position, (4) target motor position.
* **Valve control**. Takes actual and target pressure values and adjusts a valve accordingly.

### Upload to the Arduinos

There are two `.ino` file, one for the Motor-Arduino, one for the Main-Arduino.

1. Open the file at `PressureControlSoftware/MotorController/MotorController.ino` and upload it to the Motor-Arduino (the one with the motor shield).
2. Open the file at `PressureControlSoftware/PressureControlSoftware.ino` and upload it to the Main-Arduino (the one that is connected to display, potentiometers, ...).

### Parameters

Parameters can be adjusted in the header file `Parameters.h`. Not that instead of using a comma `,`, a dot `.` must be used for decimals. Lines are terminated with a semicolon `;`. 

* **Opening tolerance** `openingTolerance`, _Motor-Positions-Toleranz_, permitted value range [0,1]. Controls which deviation of target motor position and actual motor position is still tolerated until a motion is being triggered. If the motor target is e.g. `0.2`, and the measured position is `0.25`, nothing will happen with an `openingTolerance` greater than or equal to `0.05`. The tolerance for motion is derived from this value through division by 2. So while adjusting the motor position, movement will not stop unless half of the `openingTolerance` is reached.
* **Tolerated PSI delta** `toleratedPsiDelta`, _akzeptierte Differenz von Soll- und Ist-PSI_, permitted value range [0,maxPSI]. After which difference in preassure levels (target vs. actual) a motion is being triggered. Note that there is no tolerance for motion because this is already caught by the motor positioning tolerance.
* **Minimum valve opening**, `minOpening`, _geringste Ã–ffnung des Ventils_, permitted value range [0,1]. Once a deviation from the target PSI is exceeding `toleratedPsiDelta` the valve will be opened to `minOpening` the least. May be set to `0` when in doubt.
* **Max opening at PSI delta** `maxOpeningAtPsiDelta`, _Differeny von Soll- und Ist-PSI, bei der das Ventil komplett offen steht_, permitted value range [0,maxPSI). At what PSI difference the valve is openend entirely.
